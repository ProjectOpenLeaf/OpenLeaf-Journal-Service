# OWASP ZAP Custom Rules Configuration
# Format: alert_id	RISK_LEVEL	(where RISK_LEVEL = IGNORE, INFO, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
#
# This file allows you to customize which alerts ZAP reports and at what severity
# Leave blank to use default ZAP rules, or customize based on your needs

# Example: Reduce false positives or ignore certain alerts
# 10021	IGNORE	# X-Content-Type-Options header missing (if you handle this elsewhere)
# 10020	LOW	# X-Frame-Options header missing (downgrade from MEDIUM to LOW)

# SQL Injection - Keep HIGH
40018	HIGH
90018	HIGH

# XSS - Keep HIGH
40012	HIGH
40014	HIGH
40016	HIGH
40017	HIGH

# Authentication/Session Management - Keep HIGH
10202	HIGH
40013	HIGH

# CSRF - Keep MEDIUM (you use JWT tokens)
10202	MEDIUM

# Information Disclosure - Adjust as needed
10096	LOW	# Timestamp disclosure
10109	INFO	# Modern Web Application (not really a risk)

# Security Headers - Keep MEDIUM
10020	MEDIUM	# X-Frame-Options
10021	MEDIUM	# X-Content-Type-Options
10055	LOW	# CSP Header (might not be needed for API)
10063	LOW	# Feature Policy Header

# SSL/TLS - Keep HIGH (when you implement HTTPS)
# For now, you're testing on localhost HTTP, so these will be false positives

# API Specific
90033	HIGH	# Loosely Scoped JWT
90034	HIGH	# JWT None Algorithm

# Keep all other rules at their default severity
